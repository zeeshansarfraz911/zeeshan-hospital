SERP gap analysis shows what search engines currently reward for target keywords.

## Purpose

```

```

```

## SERP Features and Actions

```text
PAA → answer blocks, FAQ, support content.
Local pack → GBP, reviews, local landing pages.
AI Overview/AI Mode → entity clarity, source-worthy content, schema.
Ads → commercial intent confirmation.
Directories → claim/optimize profiles and build stronger trust pages.
Reviews → review strategy and trust proof.
```

## Competitor SERP Spread

Track for each competitor:

```text

Top 10 appearances
Top 20 appearances

```

Action
```

## SERP Gap Types

```text
Page gap: client lacks winning page type.
Content depth gap: page exists but is weaker.
Local trust gap: GBP/reviews/citations are weak.
Authority gap: competitors have stronger links.
SERP feature gap: PAA/video/AI feature exists.
Conversion gap: competitors convert better.
```

## Output Template

```text
## SERP Gap Analysis

| Query | Intent | SERP Pattern | Winning Page Type | Client Gap | Required Action |

### Repeated Competitors
| Competitor | Appears For | Winning Pages | What To Learn |

### PAA / AEO Questions
| Question | Target Page/Section | Priority |

### Required New Pages
| Page | Keywords | Why | Priority |

### Existing Pages to Improve
| Page | SERP Gap | Fix | Priority |
```

## Local SERP Handling

For local keywords, always record:

```text
Organic top 10
Map/local pack
Directories
Review platforms
City modifiers
Near-me intent
GBP competitors
```

Website pages alone may not reach query targets when local pack dominates.

## AEO/GEO Handling

If AI Overview/AI Mode data exists, record:

```text
Is AI answer present?
Which brands are mentioned?
Which sources are cited?
What format is cited?
What information is missing from client site?
```

Action:

```text
Create citation-worthy answer sections, entity pages, and supporting content.
```

## Common Mistakes

```text
Analyzing volume without SERP
Assuming one page type for all queries
Ignoring local pack
Ignoring directories
Ignoring PAA
Ignoring AI answers
Ignoring ads as commercial-intent signal
Copying competitor content
```

## Final Gate

SERP analysis is complete when each target query has:

```text
Intent
SERP pattern
Winning page type
Competitor examples
Client gap
Recommended action
Priority
```
