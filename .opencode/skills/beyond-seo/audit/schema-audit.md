# Schema and Structured Data Audit

This file defines Beyond SEO's schema audit process.

Schema is not magic ranking dust. It helps search engines and answer engines understand entities, page types, relationships, products, courses, services, local businesses, breadcrumbs, FAQs, and trust signals.

---

## 1. Purpose

Schema audit answers:

```text
Is the site using accurate structured data that matches visible content and supports search understanding?
```

---

## 2. Core Rules

Schema must be:

```text
Accurate
Visible-content backed
Relevant to page type
Valid JSON-LD or supported format
Not spammy
Not misleading
Not duplicated/conflicting
```

Never recommend:

```text
Fake review schema
Hidden FAQ schema
Fake ratings
Misleading medical/course claims
Schema that does not match visible content
```

---

## 3. Inputs

Use:

```text
Page HTML/source
Crawl output
Schema validator output
Rich Results Test output
Apify/native crawl
CMS templates
Existing JSON-LD
Visible page content
```

---

## 4. Schema Types to Check

Common types:

```text
Organization
LocalBusiness
MedicalBusiness
Dentist
Physician
Service
Course
Product
Article
FAQPage
BreadcrumbList
Person
Review / AggregateRating

```

---

## 7. Service Schema

Use for service pages when the service is clearly described.

Fields:

provider
areaServed
serviceType
url
offers if pricing is visible and accurate
```

Examples:

```

Course pages should often include:

```

## 10. FAQPage Schema

FAQPage schema should only be used when:

```text
FAQ questions and answers are visible on the page.
Questions are genuinely useful.
Answers are not spammy.
FAQ content matches page topic.
```

Do not promise rich results. Search result display can change.

Use FAQ schema primarily for:

```text
clarity
AEO/GEO extraction support
structured understanding
```

not as a guaranteed CTR boost.

---

## 11. Review and Rating Schema

Use carefully.

Allowed only when:

```text
Reviews/ratings are visible.
Reviews are about the same entity/page topic.
The business is allowed to mark them up.
Ratings are authentic.
```

Avoid:

```text
Fake reviews
Self-serving misleading review markup
Hidden reviews
Sitewide duplicate aggregate ratings
Ratings copied from third-party platforms without proper context
```

If unsure, avoid review schema and use visible testimonials without markup.

### Implementation Notes

```

---

## 19. JSON-LD Implementation Rules

Prefer JSON-LD.

Implementation must:

```text
Inject per page/template
Use canonical URL
Use correct entity IDs where possible
Avoid duplicate Organization objects with conflicting data
Use stable @id references
Validate before publishing
```

Example entity ID pattern:

```text
https://example.com/#organization
https://example.com/#website
https://example.com/about/#person-founder
https://example.com/service-page/#service
```

## 20. Developer Acceptance Criteria

When giving schema tasks to developers:

```text
Schema is server-rendered or present in final HTML.
Each page template gets correct schema type.
Fields match visible content.
No fake ratings/reviews.
No syntax errors.
Google Rich Results Test passes where applicable.
Schema validator shows no critical errors.

```

---

## 21. Common Mistakes

Do not:

Use Course schema for a generic blog post.

```

It does not mislead.
It helps search and answer engines understand the site.
```
